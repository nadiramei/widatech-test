# Invoice System Demo

This system was developed as part of the technical test requirement for Wida Tech, using React.js, Node.js, Redux, and MySQL.

There are 3 pages in this system: 'Invoice Creation', 'Invoice Card', and 'Dashboard'.


## Invoice Creation
The 'Invoice Creation' page provides a comprehensive interface for users to create new invoices. Features include:

- Product Recommendations: As the user types in the product name, the system will suggest relevant products based on input.

- Automated Price Calculation: Upon defining the quantity of products in the invoice, the system will compute the total price of the selected item(s).
- Error Handling: If any mandatory fields (invoice date, invoice due date, customer name, and sales name) are left empty upon submission, an error message will prompt users to fill in the necessary fields before proceeding.
